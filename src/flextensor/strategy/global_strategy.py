    Global offload strategy using assignment-based layer-to-block mapping for pipelined execution.

    Pipeline Execution Model:
    - Layer N computes using Block X (data transferred during Layer N-1)
    - While computing Layer N, we transfer Block Y for Layer N+1
    - Constraint: Block Y ≠ Block X (can't transfer and compute same block simultaneously)
    - Block X becomes free after Layer N finishes → can be reused for Layer N+2

    This means:
    - Minimum 2 blocks required for pipelining
    - With 2 blocks: alternating pattern (A, B, A, B, ...)
    - With 3+ blocks: more flexibility for scheduling

    The strategy uses an AssignmentStrategy (default: OptimizedRoundRobinAssignment) to
    determine layer-to-block assignments, then calculates block sizes based on the
    maximum tensor size assigned to each block.

class GlobalTensorSelectionStrategy:
    """
    Tensor-level metaheuristic optimization strategy for GPU memory offloading.

    This strategy optimizes the binary decision of whether to offload each tensor,
    maximizing GPU memory utilization while respecting memory limits and ensuring
    transfers fit within pipelined execution windows.

    Unlike GlobalOffloadStrategy which optimizes block sizes and layer assignments,
    this strategy performs fine-grained tensor selection to find the optimal
    subset of tensors to offload.

    Decision variables:
    - Binary x[i] for each tensor: 1 = offload, 0 = keep on GPU
    - Continuous scale: multiplier for compute time (transfer window)

    Constraints:
    - Hard: Peak GPU memory <= max_gpu_mem_bytes (when set)
    - Hard: Transfer time for layer N <= (layer N-1's compute time) * scale

    Objective (maximize):
    - GPU utilization in target range [target_gpu_mem, max_gpu_mem]
    - Offload ratio (secondary)
    - Prefer lower scale (less latency overhead)

    Memory Model:
    - Tensors NOT offloaded stay on GPU permanently (preloaded)
    - Peak GPU = sum(all kept tensors) + sum(block sizes)
    - Blocks are pre-allocated for pipelined transfers

    Supported Optimizers (via scipy):
    - DE: Differential Evolution (scipy.optimize.differential_evolution) -
        RECOMMENDED default. Natively handles binary variables via integrality
        constraints. Best for high-dimensional problems with many tensors.
    - SA: Simulated Annealing (scipy.optimize.dual_annealing) -
        Treats variables as continuous; less efficient for binary decisions.
        May be useful for small problems with few tensors.

        Initialize GlobalTensorSelectionStrategy.

        Args:
            max_gpu_mem_bytes: Hard GPU memory limit in bytes (never exceed).
                When ``None``, the memory constraint is disabled and the optimizer
                only respects the transfer time constraint (latency mode).
            target_gpu_mem_bytes: Soft GPU memory target in bytes. The optimizer
                aims for this peak memory to avoid over-offloading. If set without
                ``max_gpu_mem_bytes``, the target is used as the hard limit.
                When ``None``, defaults to ``max_gpu_mem_bytes``.
            scale: Duration multiplier (baseline / lower bound for the optimizer).
                ``0.9`` = 10% safety margin, ``1.0`` = exact fit (default).
            scale_ub: Upper bound for scale the optimizer may explore.
                When ``None`` (default), automatically determined by mode:
                - Latency mode (``max_gpu_mem_bytes=None``): ``scale`` (no overhead)
                - Memory mode (``max_gpu_mem_bytes`` set): ``100.0`` (wide search)
                When explicitly set, used as-is. Example: ``scale=0.9, scale_ub=1.0``
                means transfers should fit within 90-100% of compute time.
            n_blocks: Number of memory blocks (max). Used if assignment_strategy is None.
            min_blocks: Minimum number of blocks to try (default: 2).
            max_blocks: Maximum number of blocks to try (default: n_blocks).
            threshold_mb: Minimum tensor size threshold in MB (smaller tensors always kept on GPU).
            pop_size: Population size for optimization.
            epoch: Maximum number of optimization epochs.
            max_early_stop: Stop if no improvement for this many epochs.
            optimizer: Optimizer to use (default: "DE").
                Available options:
                - "DE": Differential Evolution (scipy.optimize.differential_evolution).
                    RECOMMENDED. Natively handles binary variables via integrality

                    May be useful for small problems with few tensors.
            seed_ratio: Ratio of population to seed with feasible solutions (0.0-1.0).
                Lower ratio = more random exploration.
            seed: Random seed for reproducibility. If None, uses non-deterministic seed.
            assignment_strategy: Strategy for assigning layers to blocks.
                Default: OptimizedRoundRobinAssignment (tries min_blocks to max_blocks).
                Options: StrictRoundRobinAssignment, OptimizedRoundRobinAssignment.
            transfer_window: Calculator for per-layer transfer windows.
                Default: SingleLayerWindow (previous layer's duration only).
                Use GapAwareWindow to exploit empty layers for larger transfer budgets.
