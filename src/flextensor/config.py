    .. note:: Minimum-iteration contract

        Because ``OffloadManager.update_state()`` runs as a post-forward hook,
        the PROFILING→INFERENCE transition can only fire *after* the first
        profile forward completes. Any transition — including

        forward's worth of collector data. Setting ``profiling_iters=0`` and

        low-quality strategy inputs (``report_profiling_quality`` warns).

        restore a saved profile via ``load_profile`` / ``offload_from_profile``.

    Each entry is one of three forms:

    * ``<glob>`` — name-based (module or parameter path), existing behaviour.
    * ``name:<glob>`` — name-based, explicit form.  Equivalent to ``<glob>``.
    * ``class:<glob>`` — class-based; matches modules whose class name matches
      the glob.  Each pattern is tested against both the short class name
      (``type(m).__name__``) and the fully-qualified class name
      (``f"{cls.__module__}.{cls.__qualname__}"``); a match on either wins.
      Useful for hybrid architectures where a single Python class (e.g.
      ``SharedExpertMLP``) appears at varying paths and renames across
      upstream versions.  FQCN globs such as ``class:torch.nn.*.Linear``
      provide an escape hatch when the same short name is used by multiple
      classes.

    Name patterns are matched against both module paths (from
    ``model.named_modules()``) and parameter paths (from
    ``model.named_parameters()``).

    **Module-level patterns** (e.g., ``layers.*``) patch matching modules and offload
    all their parameters.

    **Parameter-level patterns** (e.g., ``layers.*.weight``) automatically derive the
    module-level pattern (``layers.*``) for patching, but only offload parameters that
    match the full pattern. Non-matching parameters stay on GPU permanently.

    **Class patterns** patch every module of a matching class; all of that
    module's parameters are offloaded.  Class patterns are module-level only —
    ``class:*Expert*`` covers every descendant parameter of any matching module.

    Can also be set via the ``FT_INCLUDE_PATTERNS`` env var as a comma-separated list.

    .. note::
        Standalone ``*`` has different semantics depending on context:

        * **Module selection** — ``*`` matches exactly one path segment.
          ``layers.*`` matches ``layers.0`` but not ``layers.0.attn``.
        * **Parameter filtering** — ``*`` matches one or more segments.
          ``*.weight`` matches both ``linear.weight`` and ``layers.0.attn.weight``.
        * **Class matching** — ``*`` is a single-segment glob spanning the
          whole class-name string.  Short class names have no dots, so
          ``class:*Expert*`` behaves as a simple substring glob.  Patterns
          containing dots only match against the fully-qualified class name
          (e.g., ``class:*.SharedExpertMLP``).

    Validated at construction; assignment / in-place mutation bypasses validation.

    exclude_patterns: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    """Module/parameter patterns to exclude from offloading (supports wildcards).

    the short class name and the fully-qualified class name (see
    :attr:`include_patterns`).

    Applied after include_patterns: targets matching both include and exclude are NOT offloaded.
    Standalone ``*`` matches one or more segments in both module selection and parameter
    filtering, so ``foo.*`` excludes all descendants of ``foo``.  A ``class:`` match
    cascades to every descendant parameter of the matched module.

    * ``"view"`` — default. Pre-allocates substantial GPU memory during profile;

    * ``"getter"`` — property getters route parameter access through the
      per-trap loader. Lower GPU footprint, attribute-getter overhead in

    * ``"torch_function"`` — fallback for models that reject the patching used
