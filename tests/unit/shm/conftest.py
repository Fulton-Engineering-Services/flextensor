"""Shared helpers for shm multiprocess tests.

Centralizing these in conftest keeps timeout/cleanup behavior consistent across
the suite and lets us bake exitcode and child-death checks into a single place.

Event-wait timeouts default to 5s and are overridable per-run via
``FT_TEST_EVENT_TIMEOUT`` (e.g. ``FT_TEST_EVENT_TIMEOUT=15 pytest ...``) for
slow CI runners where fork+import latency can starve the default budget.
