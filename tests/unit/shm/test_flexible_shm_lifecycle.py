"""Multiprocess lifecycle tests for FlexibleSharedMemory class.

Tests the complete lifecycle of shared memory across multiple processes:
- Creation and connection
- Read/write operations across processes
- Concurrent close ordering (P0 closes while siblings are alive)
- Sequential cleanup with the last surviving process tearing down resources
- Verification of no memory leaks
